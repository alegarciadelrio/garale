I started this project with CiclosArgentinos Forum in 2011. This is Java / Eclipse!

You can calculate the following items:
-Optimal transfer height.
-Displacement of the cylinder.
-Optimal carburetor.
-The right area for the flapper.
-Compression relationship.
-Cylinder lid down.
-Surface time.
-Exhaust pipe.
-Bottle volume for YEIS.
-YEIS rpm operation.
-YEIS optimal hose.
